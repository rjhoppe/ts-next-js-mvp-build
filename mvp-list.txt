Create forms for create case, create rule, create template

Create dummy API endpoint that you can simulate (I'm thinking FastAPI and Faker):
  Ingest of data from Records
  Pushing data from Victim Notifications to Records

Add #alt tags

Clean up boilerplate
  Remove unused values

Auto assignment of case / records / templates IDs
  Templates currently don't have IDs -> this could be problematic
